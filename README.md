Adds a new building Peltier Cooler it cools down one tile and heats up another on opposite sides.
Research "HVAC" tech and it'll show up under "Utilities".
Was supposed to go with Steam Turbine, single Peltier cooler is able to provide heat for one Steam Turbine (2.5kW heat transfer rate). But ST turned out
to be too buggy, occassionally it starts to pass through all the input steam, which makes cooler+turbine set inefficient.
